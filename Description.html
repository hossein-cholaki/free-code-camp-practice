    <h1>Description</h1>
    
    <p>The h1 to h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them.</p>

    <p>The P element is used to creat a paragraph of text on websites.</p>

    <p>Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive.</p>

    <p>HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
    Identify the main section of this page by adding a MAIN  opening tag after the h1 element, and a MAIN  closing tag after the p element.</p>

    <p>In the previous step, you put the h2, comment, and p elements inside the main element. This is called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.</p>

    <p>You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.</p>

    <p>HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located)</p>

    <p>All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.</p>

    <p>You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element.</p>
