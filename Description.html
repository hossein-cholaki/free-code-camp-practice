    <h1>Description</h1>
    
    <p>The h1 to h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them.</p><br>

    <p>The P element is used to creat a paragraph of text on websites.</p><br>

    <p>Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive.</p><br>

    <p>HTML5 has some elements that identify different content areas. These elements make your HTML easier to read and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility.
    Identify the main section of this page by adding a MAIN  opening tag after the h1 element, and a MAIN  closing tag after the p element.</p><br>

    <p>In the previous step, you put the h2, comment, and p elements inside the main element. This is called nesting. Nested elements should be placed two spaces further to the right of the element they are nested in. This spacing is called indentation and it is used to make HTML easier to read.</p><br>

    <p>You can add images to your website by using the img element. img elements have an opening tag without a closing tag. A tag for an element without a closing tag is known as a self-closing tag.</p><br>

    <p>HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag of an element to control the element's behavior. The src attribute in an img element specifies the image's URL (where the image is located)</p><br>

    <p>All img elements should have an alt attribute. The alt attribute's text is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.</p><br>

    <p>You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element.</p><br>

    <p>A link's text must be placed between the opening and closing tags of an anchor (a) element.</p><br>

    <p>Before adding any new content, you should make use of a section element to separate the cat photos content from the future content.</p> <br>
    <p>When you add a lower rank heading element to the page, it's implied that you're starting a new subsection.</p><br>

    <p>The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption.</p><br>

    <p>A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the figure element</p><br>

    <p>Emphasize the word love in the figcaption element by wrapping it in an emphasis em element.</p><br>
    
    <p>The strong element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent.</p><br>

    <p>at the form element: The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent.</p><br>

    <p>The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input elements are self-closing and do not need closing tags.</p><br>

    <p>There are many kinds of inputs you can create using the type attribute. You can easily create a password field, reset button, or a control to let users select a file from their computer.</p><br>

    <p>In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted.</p><br>
