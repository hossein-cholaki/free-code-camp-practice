    <p>The h1 to h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them.</p>

    <p>The P element is used to creat a paragraph of text on websites.</p>

    <p>Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive.</p>
